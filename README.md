  Why Sentiment Analysis ?
 
 Millions of messages are appearing daily in popular web-sites that provide services for microblogging such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook. Authors of those messages write about their life, share opinions on variety of topics and discuss current issues. Because of a free format of messages and an easy accessibility
of microblogging platforms, Internet users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as traditional blogs or mails) to microblogging services. As more and more users post about products and services they use, or express their political and religious views, microblogging web-sites become valuable sources of people’s opinions and sentiments. Such data can be efficiently used
for marketing or social studies.

overall product and its features is presented to users.

destinations. They contain 75 millions opinions and

online at a high rate. That creates opportunities for
organizations to manage and strengthen brand
reputation. Now Brand perception is determined not
only by advertising, public relations and corporate
messaging. Brands are now a sum of the conversations
about them. Sentiment analysis helps in determining
how company’s brand, product or service is being
perceived by community online.


**E. Government**

Sentiment analysis helps government in assessing
their strength and weaknesses by analyzing opinions
from public. For example, “If this is the state, how do
you expect truth to come out? The MP who is
investigating 2g scam himself is deeply corrupt.”.
this example clearly shows negative sentiment about
government.
Whether it is tracking citizens’ opinions on a new
108 system, identifying strengths and weaknesses in a
recruitment campaign in government job, assessing
